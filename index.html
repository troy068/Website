<td style="width: 1707.046875px;" colspan="4">
<p style="text-align: center;">Hello! My name is Troy Tsai, and I am a motivated individual with a passion for customer service and financial services. Currently, I am based in Richmond Hill, Ontario, and I am pursuing a degree in Business Management and Organizational Studies at Western University. I am also enrolled in the Canadian Securities Course at the Canadian Securities Institute, set to complete it by August 2023.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I've had a dynamic professional journey thus far, gaining experience in multiple areas and honing a versatile set of skills. At Lifetime Fitness, I served as a Lifeguard and Swim Instructor, where I focused on ensuring the safety of guests while delivering top-tier customer service. In my role as a Graphics Designer at Outstanding International Academy, I combined my creativity and technical skills to create engaging digital content across various platforms. These experiences have shaped my ability to adapt to different situations and work effectively in team-oriented environments.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I've also had the privilege of leading as a Head of House at St. Andrew's College. This role provided me with valuable experience in leadership and event planning, and the opportunity to foster an inclusive environment. My involvement in an Enriched French Program and Advanced Placement courses helped me further my academic prowess and cultural understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My skills span across various domains, including proficiency in Microsoft Office and basic web development (HTML, CSS), problem-solving, adaptability, attention to detail, and excellent written and verbal communication. Additionally, I am bilingual in English and French, making me a versatile communicator in diverse settings.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When I am not immersed in my professional or academic pursuits, you can find me involved in various athletic activities. I have been a multi-sport athlete, a team captain for Richmond Hill Stars MD, and an Assistant Golf Coach at Summit Golf and Country Club.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">On this website, you'll find my resume, portfolio, and other information about me and my professional experience. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or opportunities that may arise. Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
